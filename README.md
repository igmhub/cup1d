### Cosmology using P1D - small scale clustering of the Lyman alpha forest

This repository contains some tools to perform the last steps of a cosmological analysis of the 1D power spectrum (P1D) of the Lyman alpha forest. 

It uses the LaCE emulator, and some extra tools to run MCMC analyses on cosmological and IGM parameters for a mock P1D measurement.
