Most Planck chains are not provided in cup1d, but they can be downloaded from
the official Planck website: https://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/planck-legacy-archive/index.php/Cosmological_Parameters

We do provide a handful of chains under $CUP1D_PATH/planck_linP_chains/

These chains have extra columns with the linear power parameters relevant
for Lyman alpha P1D: linP_DL2_star, linP_n_star, linP_alpha_star, linP_f_star,
linP_g_star.
