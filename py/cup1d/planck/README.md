Planck chains are not provided in cup1d, but they can be downloaded from
the official Planck website: https://wiki.cosmos.esa.int/planck-legacy-archive/index.php/Cosmological_Parameters

To the chains within cup1d, set an environmental variable. For instance:
export PLANCK_CHAINS = '/share/data/Planck_chains/'

The structure inside that folder should be something like:
$PLANCK_CHAINS/COM_CosmoParams_fullGrid_R3.00/base_mnu/
